## General Information
- This project is meant for a financial company. This company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface. 
- In this, we will be helping the company in taking correct data driven decisions for approving the loan applications.
- When this company receives any loan application, then it has to take the decession on whether to accept it or not. If the company doesn't accept the loan application for the customer who is likely to repay, then the company faces business loss. On the other hand, if the company accept the loan application of a person and later on, he defaults then company go through financial loss. So in this project, we will analysize different driving varibales behind the loan default which can be helpful for the company to mitigate the risks involved.
- For this analysis, we have taken the loan data of all the loans issued through the time period 2007 t0 2011.

## Conclusions
- Rental candidates have higher probability of Charged-off. But the gap is not far from 'Own' and 'Mortgage'. Candidates who haven't mentioned about their home ownership have highest chargeoff probability. So making the candidates write their accommodation type becomes important.
- As the grade of an employee lowers higher becomes the Charged-off percentage â€“ Similar is the case for sub grades.
- Higher term of leans have the highest probability of Charged-off.
- State of NE has the highest Charged-off probability.
- Month of December and May has the highest probability of Charged-off.
- Employees having 10+ years experience have the highest probability of Charged-off.
- The company should invest in people with higher salary, debt consolidation loans, employees with grade A and B, interest rates close to 15 percent but not more than that.
- People having F and G grade are being given very huge loans, there is scope to reduce that, knowing that they Charged-off the maximum.
- Verification has no impact on reducing Charged-off percentage across income groups and grades of employees.
